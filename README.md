# Weather Dashboard

A comprehensive weather application to search current and 5-day forecasts for any location


## Uses

For this app, I had to use basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an app that'll show users the current weather, as well as a 5-day forecast, for any location of their choosing

I also had to integrate a 3rd party API into the site to provide the data needed

I also used inline CSS in the JavaScript to help style the site to be more visually appealing


## Links

Here is a link to the site that provided the API: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
